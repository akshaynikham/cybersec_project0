Numerical Analysis? -
	Numerical Analysis is the study of methods to find approximate solutions to mathematical problems using numbers and computers.

Why “approximate” solutions?
	- Computers cannot store infinite digits
	- Real numbers like π, √2, e are irrational
	- Rounding is unavoidable

**Numerical methods trade exactness for feasibility.

Why Numerical Methods Are Needed?

	Real-world problems:
		- Engineering equations
		- Physics simulations
		- Machine learning
		- Control systems
		- Cybersecurity simulations (optimization, crypto, modeling)

**In C, the name of an array itself is a pointer to its first element.

Function Prototyping: 
	A function prototype is a declaration of a function that tells the compiler about the function's name, return type, and parameters before the 	function is actually defined (written out).

Loss of Significance:
	- also called "Catastrophic Cancellation"
	- is a phenomenon in floating-point math where the precision of your result suddenly drops, often leaving you with a number that is mostly "garbage" or "noise."
	- It typically happens in two specific scenarios: when you subtract two numbers that are very close in value, or when you add/subtract numbers of wildly different scales.
		- The "Subtraction" Trap (Catastrophic Cancellation)
		- The "Scale" Trap (Absorption)

Machine Epsilon: 
	- The smallest difference between 1.0 and the next representable floating-point number. 
	- It represents the "rounding unit" or the maximum relative error of a computer's number system. If a change is smaller than Epsilon, the computer "ignores" it.

Interpolation:
	- interpolation is estimating unknown data points between known values by fitting a simple function (like a line or curve) through the given points, effectively "filling the gaps" in a dataset to 		predict intermediate values, unlike extrapolation, which guesses values outside the range.
