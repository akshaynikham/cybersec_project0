Numerical Analysis? -
	Numerical Analysis is the study of methods to find approximate solutions to mathematical problems using numbers and computers.

Why “approximate” solutions?
	- Computers cannot store infinite digits
	- Real numbers like π, √2, e are irrational
	- Rounding is unavoidable

**Numerical methods trade exactness for feasibility.

Why Numerical Methods Are Needed?

	Real-world problems:
		- Engineering equations
		- Physics simulations
		- Machine learning
		- Control systems
		- Cybersecurity simulations (optimization, crypto, modeling)

**In C, the name of an array itself is a pointer to its first element.

Function Prototyping: 
	A function prototype is a declaration of a function that tells the compiler about the function's name, return type, and parameters before the 	function is actually defined (written out).

Loss of Significance:
	- also called "Catastrophic Cancellation"
	- is a phenomenon in floating-point math where the precision of your result suddenly drops, often leaving you with a number that is mostly "garbage" or "noise."
	- It typically happens in two specific scenarios: when you subtract two numbers that are very close in value, or when you add/subtract numbers of wildly different scales.
		- The "Subtraction" Trap (Catastrophic Cancellation)
		- The "Scale" Trap (Absorption)

Machine Epsilon: 
	- The smallest difference between 1.0 and the next representable floating-point number. 
	- It represents the "rounding unit" or the maximum relative error of a computer's number system. If a change is smaller than Epsilon, the computer "ignores" it.

Interpolation:
	- interpolation is estimating unknown data points between known values by fitting a simple function (like a line or curve) through the given points, effectively "filling the gaps" in a dataset to 		predict intermediate values, unlike extrapolation, which guesses values outside the range.
	- Curve passes exactly through all data points
	- Used when data is accurate

Approximation:
	- Curve does not necessarily pass through all points
	- Used when data has errors/noise

Lagrange Interpolation:
	- Intuition: Imagine you have a few scattered points on a graph, and you want to find a smooth curve (a polynomial) that passes exactly through every single one of them.
	- Lagrange Interpolation is the formula that allows you to "construct" that curve.
	- Core Idea:
		- To find one big polynomial that fits all n points, let's create n smaller 'helper' polynomials. Each helper will be responsible for exactly one point
	- How it works:
		- Suppose we have three points: (x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1), and (x_2, y_2).
		- Step 1:  The "Helper" Polynomials (L_i):
			- We create a special function for each x value. These are called Lagrange Basis Polynomials.
			- A helper function L_0 has a very specific job:
				- It must equal 1 when x = x_0.
				- It must equal 0 when x is any other given point (x_1 or x_2).
		- Step 2: Building the switch:
			- Build formula that makes x_1 and x_2 zero. 
				(x - x_1)(x - x_2)
		- Step 3: Now, to make sure it equals 1 when x = x_0, we divide it by those same values but with x_0 plugged in:
			L_0(x) = (x - x_1)(x - x_2)/(x_0 - x_1)(x_0 - x_2)
		- Step 3: Putting it all together:
			- Once we have all our helpers (L_0, L_1, L_2), we multiply each one by its corresponding y value and add them up:
				P(x) = y_0L_0(x) + y_1L_1(x) + y_2L_2(x)
	- Pros & Cons:
		
		Pros								Cons
		Simple to code: No complex matrix math needed.			Computationally Expensive: It takes O(n^2) time.
		Exact: It passes exactly through every point.			Wiggle Problem (Runge's Phenomenon): With too many points, the edges of the curve start to "wiggle" wildly.
		Direct: You don't need to solve for coefficients first.		Hard to update: Adding one new point requires recalculating everything.



Newton’s Forward Interpolation:
	- Newton’s method:
		Uses finite differences
		Easier to compute
	- Use Case Scenario:
		Data points are equally spaced
		Interpolation point is near the beginning of table
	- Advantages & Limitations
		Advantages
			- Efficient
			- Easy to update
			- Uses difference table

		Limitations
			- Equal spacing required
			- Accuracy reduces far from x₀

	- It is based on the idea of "Finite Differences"—looking at how the 1y values change step-by-step.
	- The Core Concept: The Difference Table
		- First Difference (△ y_0): y_1 - y_0
		- Second Difference (△^2 y_0): △ y_1 - △ y_0
	- The Formula:
		- y_x = y_0 + p * △ y_0 + p(p-1)/2! * △^2 y_0 + p(p-1)(p-2)/3! * △^3 y_0 + ....
	- What is p?
		- In Newton's method, we don't use x directly. We use a "normalized" distance called p (sometimes called u). It tells us how far we are from the start point (x_0) 				in terms of "steps": p = x - x_0/h
		- Where h is the fixed interval between points, like 1 or 10
	- constant difference [ the secret decoder]:
		- The computer doesn't know what your curve looks like. It just sees the numbers 1, 3, 6, 10.

		- By doing these subtractions, the computer discovers:
			- The Shape: "It took 2 steps to find a constant, so I need an x^2 formula."
			- The Growth: "The constant is 1, so I know exactly how much to bend the curve."
	- The "Secret" Summary:
		- If the 1st subtraction is constant -> The data is a Straight Line.
		- If the 2nd subtraction is constant -> The data is a Simple Curve (Parabola).
		- If the 3rd subtraction is constant -> The data is a Complex Curve (S-shape).
	-  Why p(p-1), p(p-1)(p-2), etc.?
		- they make sure the formula hits the data points exactly.
		- Think of them as "Safety Switches":At the 1st point (p=0):The term p becomes 0. This "shuts off" the Speed and the Bend, leaving you with only the Height.
		- At the 2nd point (p=1):The term (p-1) becomes (1-1) = 0. This "shuts off" the Bend, leaving you with just Height + Speed.
		- At the 3rd point (p=2):The term (p-2) would become 0, shutting off the next layer of complexity. 


Newton’s backward Interpolation:
	- If Newton Forward Interpolation is about starting at the beginning and looking ahead, Newton Backward Interpolation is about starting at the very end of your data and looking 		back.
	- We use this when we want to estimate a value near the end of a table
	- Ex: if you have data for 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024, and you want to predict something for late 2024
	- Key difference:
		Feature,	Forward Difference,		Backward Difference
		Starting Point	Uses x0​ (First point),		Uses xn​ (Last point)
		Direction,	Looks forward (Δ),		Looks backward (∇)
		The "P" Formula	p=(x−x0​)/h,			p=(x−xn​)/h
		The "P" Product	p(p−1)(p−2)…,			p(p+1)(p+2)…
	- The Backward Difference Table:
		- The table is built exactly the same way (by subtracting), but we focus on the bottom diagonal instead of the top.
		- The symbol for backward difference is ▽ (Nabla)
			-	▽y_n = y_n - y_n-1 
			-	▽^2y_n = ▽y_n - ▽y_n-1
	- The Formula:
		Because we are moving "backward" into the past relative to the last point, the signs in the formula change to plus:
		y = y_n + p▽y_n + p(p+1)/2! ▽^2y_n + p(p+1)(p+2)/3! ▽^3y_n + ...
	
	- Visual Intuition: 
		- The "End-Point Anchor"Imagine you are at the finish line of a race and you want to guess where a runner was 2 seconds ago.
		- Start: You start at the Finish Line height (y_n).
		- Speed: you use the runner's final speed (▽y_n) to project backward.
		- Bend: You use the final acceleration (▽^2y_n) to curve the path.


Newton's Divided Difference:
	- Forward and Backward methods require the x values to be perfectly spaced (like 1, 2, 3)
	- Divided Difference works for any x values (like 1, 5, 12, 100)
	- The Core Idea: "Slope of Slopes":
		- In the Forward method, we just subtracted y values
		- In Divided Difference, we calculate the actual slope (the rate of change) between points.
		- The notation looks like this: f[x_0, x_1]. This is just math-speak for:
				y_1 - y_0
				-----------
				x_1 - x_0
		- It’s essentially: 	Change in Height
					------------------
					Change in Distance
	- The Divided Difference Table:
		- How to calculate the layers:
		- 1st Difference: y_1 - y_0 / x_1 - x_0
		- 2nd Difference: (Result_2 - Result_1) / (x_2 - x_0) (we divide by the distance between x_2 and x_0)4
		- 3rd Difference: (Result_B - Result_A) / (x_3 - x_0)
	
	- The Formula:
		- Instead of a "step counter," we use the actual x distances:
		- P(x) = a_0 + a_1(x - x_0) + a_2(x - x_0)(x - x_1) + a_3(x - x_0)(x - x_1)(x - x_2) ....
		- a_0 = y_0 (The Height)
		- a_1 = f[x_0, x_1] (The Speed)
		- a_2 = f[x_0, x_1, x_2] (The Bend)
